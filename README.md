# Cash-App-Stocks-Challenge


##How to run your project.
The simulator's minimum version is 13.0
There is no other pre require to build the project

##What area(s) did you focus on when working on the project?
Focus areas, trade-offs, and reason: 
###UI:
I started using .xib and changed the strategy to start working with viewCode in order to improve the code review
###Architecture:
I started using MVC but thinking about adding new features and responsibilities I changed to MVVM, it's a better
approach when thinking about unit testing and responsibility segregation for data control and view control
###Network:
I started creating a simple function but not reusable, so I separated the service layer creating a protocol to 
be reusable. In this part, I did some research to get in a better code.

##Skills and areas of expertise
During this project, I had more facilities in the creation of the screen and in the definition and organization
of the method's responsibility following the SOLID principals
